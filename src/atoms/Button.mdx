# Buttons

<Meta of={ButtonStories} />

A button is the main point of user interaction with a site.

Individual buttons can be styled at a brand level.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Primary} />
<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Secondary} />

Buttons can feature an icon.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.PrimaryWithIcon} />
<Canvas of={ButtonStories.SecondaryWithIcon} />

Buttons can be icon-only. These icons are from Tailwind's companion icon library, [heroicons](https://heroicons.com/).

<Canvas of={IconButtonStories.IconOnly} />

<Title>Button Groups & Dropdowns</Title>

Aside from grouping buttons on the fly, we have pre-coded Button Groups & Dropdowns for specific situations.

<Canvas of={ButtonGroupStories.WithWords} />
<Canvas of={ButtonGroupStories.WithIcons} />
<Canvas of={DropdownGroupStories.Dropdown} story={{ height: "125px" }} />
